# Welcome to PyRVA

The Python language is a rarity in the software industry: accessible to almost everyone, versatile across application domains and generally a joy to work with. While enjoying Python alone is beneficial, PyRVA believes that Python is best enjoyed in the company of others. We are busy organizing talks, hackathons, workshops and more to help build up the Python community here in Richmond. Ideas are welcome.
