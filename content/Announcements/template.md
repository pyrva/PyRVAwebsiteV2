## PyRVA lecture night
### Wednesday, July 13 at 7:00pm

This is a placeholder event so you know when to plan to be there.

---
PyRVA Meets twice a month. Feel free to come early and ask questions or just hang out. After each meeting, we will generally hang out for a bit and can also answer any questions at that time.

Lecture Night: 2nd Wednesday of the month
We bring speakers in from around the country to teach us something new about Python. You'll be able to ask the speaker(s) any questions you have on the topic.
Let us know if you would like to present at a future meeting! https://forms.gle/q8w3xziArWjud5f67

Coding Night: 4th Thursday of the month
Here you will find the Python challenge problems and projects that we will solve together in small groups. Please contact an organizer if you're interested in proposing a project or topic.
